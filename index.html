</section>

<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Every YouTuber starting out has to make a big decision: should they stick to what they're good at or try out different kinds of content? With over 2.7 billion users on YouTube and 500 hours of video uploaded every minute, the competition is very strong. Deciding whether to focus on a niche or to mix it up can really shape how your channel grows, how well you connect with your audience, and how successful you'll be in the long run.</p>

  <p>The goal of this project is to investigate this trade-off between specialization and diversification. By analyzing the YouNiverse dataset, which is made up of over 136,000 channels and 72 million videos, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can guide content creators in making informed decisions about their content strategy.</p>

  <p>Restricting ourselves to established channels with at least 10,000 subscribers, we examine how different approaches to diversification correlated with metrics of success, from subscriber growth to audience engagement.</p>

<section id="research-questions">
  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
  <p>To systematically explore the relationship between content diversity and channel success, we investigate six central questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Do YouTube channels with diverse content attract larger audiences and higher growth rates than those focused on a single topic?</li>
    <li>How does content diversity affect viewer engagement and loyalty?</li>
    <li>Is there a tipping point in content variety where audience fragmentation outweighs engagement benefits?</li>
    <li>Are there any relationships between categories?</li>
    <li>Which combination of categories is most effective for audience growth?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to predict the categorical cluster of a channel giving timeseries data?</li>
  </ol>
</section>


<section id="data-overview">
  <h2>The Data</h2>
  <p>The YouNiverse dataset contains over 136,000 English-language YouTube channels and more than 72 million videos. We focuse on channels with more than 10,000 subscribers and at least 10 videos. This allows us to capture established creators and avoid noise from very small channels. At the same time, however, it is important to acknowledge the possibility that we thereby introduce a bias by excluding smaller channels whose growth trajectories might differ.</br>
  With this in mind, let us have a look at the distribution of channels and subscribers across categories.</p>
  <p style="color: red;">TODO: change into pie charts. Plotly for some interactivity?</p>
  <img src="assets/img/channel-category-distr.png" alt="Plot 2">
  <img src="assets/img/subscribers-across-categories.png" alt="Plot 3">
  </p>As we can see, the distribution of YouTube channels across categories is heavily dominated by Music, Entertainment, Gaming, and People & Blogs which together make up approximately 63% of all channels. These four big players are followed by a range of other categories having a large number of creators actively contributing to them. On the other end of the spectrum, more niche categories, such as Nonprofits & Activism and Pets & Animals, have far fewer channels, telling us that their appeal is much more specialized.

When we look at the distribution of subscription volume across these categories, a similar trend appears, but with a few key differences. While the same four dominant categories together account for roughly 66% of subscriptions, Entertainment takes over in subscriber share. Categories like Education and Sports have a significant number of channels but a smaller share of subscribers, which could indicate more competition, i.e., a fragmented viewership. </p>
 </p>Let's take a look the average number of videos per channel for each category to understand content creation patterns. </p>
 
  <img src="assets/img/avg-number-videoes-per-category.png.png" alt="Plot 4">
   </p>News & Politics channels have the highest number of videos per channel by far, publishing numerous videos each day to cover global events.

Let's plot the total number of videos across all channels per category to compare the overall content volume.</p>
 <img src="assets/img/total-number-videos-per-category.png" alt="Plot 5">
  </p> News & Politics remain in the lead despite their relatively low number of channels thanks to their large amount of videos, they are closely followed by categories like Entertainment, Music, and Gaming, which have a significantly larger number of channels.</p>
  </p>   Afterwards, we visualize the average join date for each category to compare the relative age of channels across different categories. </p>
  <img src="assets/img/Average-join-date.png" alt="Plot 6">
   </p> On average, the oldest channels are found in the Nonprofits & Activism and Auto & Vehicles categories, likely due to their long-established presence and stable audience. In contrast, the most recent channels, driven by trends and shifting interests, are found in People & Blogs and Gaming.  </p>
  </p> Now we can examine how views are distributed among various categories, providing insights into which categories attract the most attention and engagement.</p>
   <img src="assets/img/Total-number-of-total-views.png.png" alt="Plot 7">
   </p>The categories that gather the most views are Entertainment and Music, as these categories are more general and trendy. In contrast, more niche categories like Autos & Vehicles, Pets & Animals, or Travel & Events are more specialized.</p>
  </p> The graph below examines the relationship between the number of views and the number of subscribers across different categories, using data from the channels and time_series datasets. This analysis aims to highlight how engagement varies by a ratio between videos & subscribers.  </p>
    <img src="assets/img/views-per-video.png" alt="Plot 8">

  </p> Since the creation of recommendation algorithms, fewer people watch videos from their subscribers list and tend to click on videos shown on their home page. Categories like Music are recommended to more people, but users don’t subscribe as much. The same scenario applies to categories like Comedy or Film & Animation. In contrast, Gaming or News & Politics offer more specialized content and are recommended primarily to fans. This graph is strongly correlated to whether a channel targets a general audience.</p>
   </p> Let’s dive into the trends in views and subscribers over time to uncover interesting patterns and insights across different categories.</p>
  <img src="assets/img/total-monthly-suscribers-per-category.png" alt="Plot 9">
    <img src="assets/img/ total-number-videos-per-category.png" alt="Plot 10">
   </p> These two graphs show a cyclical evolution in the number of subscribers and views. This can be influenced by time periods when more people use YouTube, such as during holidays. Additionally, in winter, people tend to stay indoors and watch more content online.

We observe a spike in subscribers in March 2023 for the Music category, which could be due to a music artist going viral and gaining subscribers rapidly.

However, we lack sufficient data between 2015 and the end of 2016, which prevents us from fully analyzing the entire period from 2015 to 2019. </p>

  </p>   Let’s now look at the monthly evolution of newly created channels to explore trends across different categories. </p>
     <img src="assets/img/number-of-channel-created.png" alt="Plot 10">
    <p>This graph, which represents the number of channels created per month by category, reveals several interesting trends:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First, it's important to note that our dataset represents videos from channels with more than 10k subscribers and more than 10 videos—channels that have essentially "made it". This is evident in the effects at the extremes of the graph. This limitation could introduce bias into our analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
            One notable trend is a general increase in all categories around 2012, likely due to a broader effect, possibly related to YouTube's growth or access at that time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additionally, we observe that music channels were dominant until mid-2014, with peaks in channel creation driven by trends, as YouTube was primarily used to share music during this period. Few people were making a living on YouTube in other domains, which explains the lower creation rates in those categories.
        </li>
        <li>
            As the years go by, however, <strong>Entertainment</strong> and <strong>People & Blogs</strong> categories begin to emerge as YouTube staples, with more individuals becoming well-known and turning their channels into full-time careers, pushing these categories to the forefront by 2017.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Co_occurrence matrix and heatmap</h3>
    <p>
        In the initial phase of our analysis, we will compute the co-occurrence matrix of categories across YouTube channels and visualize it using a heatmap and a network graph. The primary objective is to uncover relationships and overlaps between different types of content, which will allow us to gain insights into content diversification strategies and niche formation on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        Understanding how categories co-occur will help us detect strong connections between content types (for instance: "Gaming" and "Music"), potentially indicating channels that cater to overlapping audiences. By visualizing these relationships as a network, we will highlight tightly connected clusters, revealing content ecosystems and emerging trends.
    </p>
    <p>
        This analysis will also serve as a foundation for inspecting channel diversity in subsequent phases. By identifying which channels cover multiple categories, we can better understand the impact of content diversification on channel growth and audience engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="assets/img/heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap">
    </p>
    <h4>Observations</h4>
    <p>
        The heatmap indicates that categories such as Entertainment and People & Blogs serve as central connectors among other categories. Additionally, it highlights frequent co-occurrences among categories like Gaming, Music, Film & Animation, and Comedy.
    </p>

    <h3>Co_occurrence Network</h3>
    <p>
        To better understand the relationships between different content categories, we analyze the co-occurrence patterns between them across channels. By visualizing these co-occurrences in a network plot, we can uncover clusters of categories that frequently appear together, providing insights into content strategies and audience interests. This visualization will help us identify key content synergies and how channels group their themes, ultimately shedding light on the dynamics of content diversification on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="assets/img/conetwork.png" alt="Conetwork">
    </p>
    <h4>Observations</h4>
    <p>
        The central role of the "People & Blogs" and "Entertainment" categories suggests they serve as hubs that connect various other content genres on YouTube. These more general, cross-cutting categories likely overlap with and incorporate elements from more specialized categories. The clustering of "Gaming", "Music", "Comedy", and "Film & Animation" indicates these genres tend to co-occur and may share common audiences or creative elements. This makes sense, as gaming, music, comedy, and animated content often intersect in the entertainment space.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similarly, the clustering of "Education" and "Howto & Style" points to synergies between instructional/tutorial content and self-improvement/lifestyle content. These categories likely cater to viewers seeking knowledge and personal development. The relative isolation of categories like "Sports", "Science & Technology", and "News & Politics" suggests they have more distinct, specialized content that does not overlap as readily with the broader entertainment and lifestyle-oriented categories. These genres likely appeal to more niche audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        After visualizing the co-occurrence network, we will apply clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of categories more clearly. This will help us pinpoint content clusters that frequently co-occur, revealing patterns in how channels organize their topics. To achieve this, we will use Louvain's method, a community detection algorithm that maximizes modularity to find optimal groupings. The method works by iteratively assigning nodes (categories) to communities in a way that increases the density of edges within communities while minimizing the density between them, providing clear, meaningful clusters.
    </p>
    <p><em>Let's make things more interactive!</em></p>
    <p>
        <img src="assets/img/interractive_conetwork.png" alt="Interactive Conetwork">
    </p>
     </p> This plot reinforces the clusters identified in the previous visualization. However, it also highlights a limitation of Louvain's algorithm: it fails to recognize isolated categories as distinct clusters. Instead, these categories are often grouped with others, despite not sharing significant co-occurrence relationships. This issue arises because Louvain's method focuses on maximizing modularity, which can sometimes lead to less accurate representations of small or isolated communities that lack strong connections. To address this, additional refinement techniques or alternative community detection algorithms might be necessary to better capture these isolated categories.    </p>
