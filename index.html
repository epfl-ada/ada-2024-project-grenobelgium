  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="color: red;">TODO</p>
  <p>With millions of videos and hundreds of thousands of channels, YouTube is a content universe. We explored whether channels benefit from focusing on a single category or covering many topics. Using the large-scale YouNiverse dataset, we reveal how content variety correlates with subscriber counts, engagement, and long-term growth.</p>

  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Do YouTube channels with diverse content attract larger audiences and higher growth rates than those focused on a single topic?</li>
    <li>How does content diversity affect viewer engagement and loyalty?</li>
    <li>Is there a tipping point in content variety where audience fragmentation outweighs engagement benefits?</li>
    <li>Are there any relationships between categories?</li>
    <li>Which combination of categories is most effective for audience growth?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to predict the categorical cluster of a channel giving timeseries data?</li>

  <h2>The Data</h2>
  <p>The YouNiverse dataset contains over 136,000 English-language YouTube channels and more than 72 million videos. We focused on channels with more than 10k subscribers and at least 10 videos. This allowed us to capture established creators and avoid noise from very small channels. At the same time, however, it is important to acknowledge the possibility that we introduced a bias by excluding smaller channels, which may have different characteristics and/or growth trajectories.</br>
  With this in mind, let us have a look at the distribution of channels and subscribers across categories.</p>
  <p style="color: red;">TODO: change into pie charts. Plotly for some interactivity?</p>

  <!-- <p>As we can see, the dataset is dominated by channels in the Entertainment, Music, Gaming, and People & Blogs categories which reflects their potential to appeal to broad audiences. The YouTube landscape also contains a significant number of channels dealing with topics like Howto & Style, Education, and Sports, whereas categories such as Nonprofits & Activism and Pets & Animals are more niche, resulting in fewer channels.</p> -->
  </p>As we can see, the distribution of YouTube channels across categories is heavily dominated by Music, Entertainment, and Gaming, which together make up a large portion of all channels. Categories like People & Blogs and Howto & Style are also quite prominent, showing that a diverse range of creators are actively contributing to these spaces. On the other hand, more niche categories, such as Nonprofits & Activism and Pets & Animals, have far fewer channels, reflecting their more specialized appeal.

When we look at the distribution of subscribers across these categories, a similar trend appears, but with a few key differences. While Entertainment and Music still lead the way, Entertainment pulls ahead in subscriber share, suggesting that channels in this category tend to attract larger audiences. Categories like Education and Sports have a significant number of channels but a smaller share of subscribers, which may indicate more competition or fragmented viewership. Interestingly, categories like Comedy and Film & Animation stand out by achieving a solid share of subscribers despite having fewer channels overall, suggesting that these categories may have a higher concentration of popular channels.

In short, the distribution of channels and subscribers highlights the dominance of popular categories, but the differences between the two reveal interesting insights about audience preferences and the level of competition across YouTubeâ€™s landscape.</p>
