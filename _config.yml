description: "This project investigates how content diversity within YouTube channels influences audience growth, engagement, and loyalty by analyzing the YouNiverse dataset. By classifying channels based on the variety of content they produce, we aim to compare the performance of diverse-content channels (those covering multiple topics) with single-topic channels. We expect that while channels with mixed content will attract broader audiences and show higher growth, specialized channels might foster stronger viewer loyalty. The study will contribute to understanding the trade-offs in content variety and explore whether there's a tipping point where excessive diversity begins to fragment audiences."
