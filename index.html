<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Every YouTuber, at some point, faces a big question: should they stick to what they're good at or try something new? With over 2.7 billion users and 500 hours of video uploaded every minute, it's not an easy choice. The competition is massive, and whether you focus on one niche or branch out into different types of content can completely change how your channel grows, how well you connect with your audience, and how far you go.

  <p>The goal of this project is to figure out this trade-off between sticking to a niche and mixing it up. We're looking at the YouNiverse dataset, which comprises over 136,000 channels and 72 million videos, to uncover patterns and insights that can help creators make smarter choices about their content strategy.</p>

  <p>To keep things simple, we focus on established channels with at least 10,000 subscribers. The idea is to see how different degrees of content diversity within a channel tie into success, from growing subscribers to keeping audiences engaged. But to really understand this, we need to break it down into key questions to guide our analysis.</p>
</section>

<section id="research-questions">
  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
  <p>To systematically explore the relationship between content diversity and channel success, we investigate six central questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Do YouTube channels with diverse content attract larger audiences and higher growth rates than those focused on a single topic?</li>
    <li>How does content diversity affect viewer engagement and loyalty?</li>
    <li>Is there a tipping point in content variety where audience fragmentation outweighs engagement benefits?</li>
    <li>Are there any relationships between categories?</li>
    <li>Which combination of categories is most effective for audience growth?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to predict the categorical cluster of a channel giving timeseries data?</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Data Overview</h2>
  <div>
    <p><strong>[Scene: The YouNiverse Observatory, a dome of glowing charts and buzzing datapads. Yotuda, the wise sage of data, stands at the center, cloaked in holographic light. The apprentice enters, looking both curious and mildly overwhelmed.]</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Welcome to the YouNiverse Observatory. Vast, isn’t it? Over 136,000 YouTube channels and 72 million videos, floating in a cosmos of views and likes. It’s enough to make even a seasoned analyst say, “Let’s simplify.” And so we did.</p>

    <p>[Yotuda waves a hand. A cascade of smaller dots representing channels fades away.]</p>

    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Behold! Channels with more than 10,000 subscribers and at least 10 videos. A filter, yes, but also a choice. We focus on creators who’ve made it—the stars of this show. Yet, by doing so, we risk ignoring the strategies of newer creators, those who might one day rival these giants. A trade-off, as always.</p>

    <p><strong>Apprentice:</strong> Like choosing between coffee and sleep?</p>

    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Precisely. Both have value, but only one gets you through a deadline. Now, look closer.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Category Distribution</h3>
    <iframe src="assets/plots/category_distribution.html" width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="0" style="display:block; margin-bottom:-150px;"></iframe>
    <iframe src="assets/plots/subscribers_distribution.html" width="100%" height="800px" frameborder="0" style="display:block; margin-bottom:-175px;"></iframe>

    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Ah, categories. These are the constellations of the YouNiverse. Music, Entertainment, Gaming, and People & Blogs—together, they dominate the skies, claiming 63% of all channels. But their hunger for subscribers is even greater: 66% of all subscriptions are theirs. Entertainment, of course, shines the brightest.</p>

    <p><strong>Apprentice:</strong> But some categories look… scattered?</p>

    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Yes, Education and Sports. Many channels they boast, but their audiences are like grains of sand on a beach—plentiful, but hard to gather in one place. A lesson in the cost of competition, perhaps.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Content Creation Patterns</h3>
    <p>[The holograms shift to show bar charts labeled “Videos Per Channel” and “Total Videos Per Category.”]</p>

    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> And now, the rhythm of creation. News & Politics—unstoppable. The most videos per channel by far. Why? To cover global events, they must be relentless. No time for cat videos when there’s a summit in progress.</p>

    <img src="assets/img/avg-number-videoes-per-category.png" alt="Plot 4">
    <p>News & Politics channels have the highest number of videos per channel by far, publishing numerous videos each day to cover global events.</p>

    <img src="assets/img/total-number-videos-per-category.png" alt="Plot 5">
    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Yet, when we look at total content volume, the picture changes. News & Politics still lead, but not by much. Categories like Entertainment, Music, and Gaming have far more channels contributing to the stream. A flood of content, but with less intensity per creator.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Channel Age Distribution</h3>
    <p>[A new chart appears, marked “Channel Join Dates.”]</p>

    <img src="assets/img/Average-join-date.png" alt="Plot 6">
    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> The timeline of the YouNiverse. Nonprofits & Activism and Autos & Vehicles—old souls. These channels have been around since the early days, steady and loyal. But the young ones? People & Blogs and Gaming. Fast-moving, trend-following, their rise fueled by shifting interests.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Engagement and Viewer Patterns</h3>
    <p>[The air crackles as graphs labeled “Views Per Category” and “Subscriber-View Ratios” appear.]</p>

    <img src="assets/img/Total-number-of-total-views.png" alt="Plot 7">
    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Now, let’s talk engagement. See how views gather like fireflies. Entertainment and Music—bright, captivating, universal in their appeal. But the niche categories? Autos & Vehicles, Pets & Animals, Travel & Events. Their light is softer, their charm more specialized.</p>

    <img src="assets/img/views-per-video.png" alt="Plot 8">
    <p><strong>Apprentice:</strong> And this ratio—views versus subscribers?</p>
    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> A tale of algorithms, it is. Music, Comedy, Film & Animation—recommended widely, yet their subscribers remain few. The masses click, but loyalty lags. Gaming and News & Politics, on the other hand, cultivate niches. Their fans are fewer, but deeply engaged.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Trends Over Time</h3>
    <p>[The charts flicker, showing peaks and valleys labeled “Views Over Time” and “Subscribers Over Time.”]</p>

    <img src="assets/img/total-monthly-suscribers-per-category.png" alt="Plot 9">
    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> Patterns emerge. Cycles of activity tied to seasons and holidays. Winter, when the world retreats indoors, and subscribers grow. March 2023—Music sees a spike. A viral artist, perhaps? Yet, beware the gaps. Missing data from 2015 to 2016 veils parts of the story.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Channel Creation Trends</h3>
    <img src="assets/img/number-of-channel-created.png" alt="Plot 10">
    <p><strong>Yotuda:</strong> And here, the birth of stars. Around 2012, a surge across all categories. Perhaps YouTube itself was expanding, pulling creators into its orbit. Music reigned supreme until mid-2014. Then, a shift. Entertainment and People & Blogs rose, fueled by creators turning passion into careers.</p>

    <h2>Community Detection on Categories</h2>
    
    <div class="scene">
        <p>
            <em>[Scene: The YouNiverse Observatory. The swirling holograms of data slowly dissolve as Yotuda turns to address the apprentice one last time.]</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Yotuda:</strong> Young one, our journey so far has uncovered much—patterns of creation, bursts of engagement, and the timeless dance of creators and audiences. But the YouNiverse isn’t just stars floating in isolation; it’s a constellation of connections. To truly grasp its beauty, we must explore the threads that bind categories together. I leave you now in the capable hands of someone who knows these ties better than anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[With a flourish, Yotuda fades into the ambient glow of data. A new figure appears, cloaked in a tapestry of interconnected nodes and lines—a spirited character with a sharp wit and a penchant for unraveling complexity.]</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Zentron:</strong> Greetings, I’m Zentron, navigator of networks and unraveler of interrelations! Where Yotuda sees stars, I see strings—the web that makes this YouNiverse hum. Shall we begin?
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>The Heatmap: Where Categories Mingle</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Behold, the heatmap! Not as flashy as a supernova, but it tells a tale just as grand. Each cell here shows how often two categories cozy up to each other. Entertainment and People & Blogs? Oh, they’re the life of the party, connecting everyone like social butterflies at a networking event.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Apprentice:</strong> And these others—Gaming, Music, Comedy, Film & Animation—they’re like the cool kids hanging out in their own corner?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Exactly! Strong overlaps here suggest they’re the backbone of YouTube’s creative chaos. They often borrow from each other—think gamers vibing to epic soundtracks or animators tossing in hilarious comedy skits.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="assets/img/heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap showing category overlaps">
    </p>
    
    <h3>The Network Plot: Nodes and Edges</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Now, let’s connect the dots—literally. Here, categories are nodes, and their co-occurrence is shown as edges. It’s like a map of who’s hanging out with whom in the YouTube cafeteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>[Zentron zooms in on clusters.]</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> See how People & Blogs and Entertainment are at the center? They’re like universal adapters, plugging into every other category. Meanwhile, specialized nodes like Science & Technology, Sports, and News & Politics prefer their own corners, sipping tea and discussing niche topics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Apprentice:</strong> What about Education and Howto & Style? They seem close.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> A match made in intellectual heaven. Tutorials meet lifestyle hacks—because who doesn’t want to learn how to bake sourdough and dress like a Parisian?
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    
    <h3>Clustering the Clusters: Louvain’s Method</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Now for my pièce de résistance—clustering! Louvain’s method groups these nodes into communities, maximizing modularity to show where the strongest bonds lie. Watch as the nodes sort themselves, revealing their social circles.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>[The apprentice watches as clusters of categories emerge.]</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Look at this! Gaming, Music, Comedy, and Film & Animation form one big, happy family. Meanwhile, Education and Howto & Style carve out their intellectual niche. Sports and News & Politics stand as lone wolves—specialized, yes, but less likely to cross paths with the broader crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Apprentice:</strong> And yet, some categories seem misplaced, like guests at the wrong party.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Ah, sharp eye. Louvain isn’t perfect. Isolated categories sometimes get lumped into larger clusters, even if they don’t quite fit. It’s like sticking a quiet poet in a room full of jazz musicians—they might find a rhythm, but it’s not a perfect match.
    </p>

    <h3>Interactive Network: The YouNiverse in Motion</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Now, try this! With an interactive network, you can zoom, pan, and explore connections yourself. Notice how some links shine brighter, revealing strong ties, while others barely flicker, hinting at weaker overlaps.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>[The apprentice clicks on nodes, marveling at the dynamic connections.]</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> A word of caution: no algorithm captures everything. Some isolated categories remain stubbornly enigmatic, defying easy classification. To refine this, we might need a different approach—perhaps algorithms that value uniqueness over connection density.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Apprentice:</strong> It’s incredible. These clusters feel alive, almost like they’re telling their own stories.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> That’s the magic of networks—they reveal the hidden harmonies of a chaotic world. And remember, connections aren’t just about numbers; they’re about relationships. Behind every node is a creator, behind every edge, an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>[Zentron steps back, the network shimmering around them.]</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Zentron:</strong> Take what you’ve learned, young one, and explore further. The YouNiverse is vast, and every connection you uncover adds another thread to its tapestry.

<h2>The Awakening of the Researcher: A Quest for Diversity</h2>
        <p>After an intense discussion with Yotuda and Zentron about the interwoven dynamics of content diversity across distant galaxies, the EPFL researcher jolted awake, drenched in sweat. His eyes flickered to the clock: the real world was waiting. The dream he had just experienced—a vast cosmic exploration of channels, categories, and their hidden relationships—was, in retrospect, too vivid to ignore. The conversation with Yotuda about entropy and the cryptic mathematical intricacies revealed by Zentron seemed so real that it shook him. He tried to recall the equations, the formulas, and the algorithms that had arisen during those interactions.</p>

        <p>But as the dream began to fade, something extraordinary happened: an epiphany.</p>

        <p>He quickly grabbed a pen and began scribbling. Could these findings actually be translatable into a real-world problem? Could there be a way to measure the diversity of content on a channel—not just by how many different categories a channel covers, but by how related those categories are? Could there be a single metric that balances both spread and relatedness in a quantitative, interpretable way?</p>

        <p>With determination, he began to formalize his thoughts. It was time to bring this dream to life. He would design a Channel Diversity Metric—a unified model that would capture the essence of content diversity in a rigorous mathematical framework.</p>

        <h3>Designing the Channel Diversity Metric: A Quantitative Approach to Content Diversity</h3>

        <h5>1. Entropy: A Measure of Category Distribution</h5>
        <p>The first step in his metric was rooted in an established principle: entropy. Entropy measures the spread of categories on a channel, providing an indication of how diverse the content is. If a channel’s content is focused on a narrow set of categories, the entropy will be low; conversely, a broader distribution across many categories will result in higher entropy.</p>

        <p>The entropy formula is defined as:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            H = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot \log(p_i)
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>p_i</code> represents the proportion of content in category <code>i</code> (estimated directly from the channel’s content distribution).</li>
            <li><code>n</code> is the total number of unique categories within the channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A higher entropy implies that the channel covers a wide variety of topics, while lower entropy suggests a more concentrated focus on a few categories.</p>

        <h5>2. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI): Adjusting for Category Relationships</h5>
        <p>But entropy alone didn’t capture the whole story. A channel could cover a range of categories, yet if many of those categories were related (for example, “Gaming” and “Esports”), the channel might seem diverse but actually focus on overlapping themes. To address this, the researcher needed a way to account for the relatedness between categories.</p>

        <p>Here, the concept of Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) came into play. NMI measures how much information two categories share. If two categories frequently co-occur, their NMI will be high, indicating they are not truly independent. This overlap would reduce the channel's true diversity, so a penalty would be applied.</p>

        <p>The formula for NMI between two categories <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> is defined as:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \text{NMI}(i,j) = \frac{I(i,j)}{\max(H(i), H(j))}
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>I(i,j)</code> is the mutual information between categories <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, calculated as:</li>
            <p>
                \[
                I(i,j) = p_{ij} \cdot \log \left( \frac{p_{ij}}{p_i \cdot p_j} \right)
                \]
            </p>
            <li><code>p_{ij}</code> represents the probability of categories <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> co-occurring across all channels.</li>
            <li><code>p_i</code> and <code>p_j</code> are the global marginal probabilities for categories <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, respectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3. The Full Channel Diversity Metric</h5>
        <p>With entropy capturing the spread of content and NMI adjusting for category relatedness, the researcher now needed to combine these elements into a single metric. The final Channel Diversity Metric would capture both the distribution of content across categories and the relationships between categories. The formula becomes:</p>
        <p>
            \[
            \text{Channel Diversity} = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot \log(p_i) \cdot \left( 1 - \text{NMI}(i,j) \right) / \log(n)
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>p_i</code> represents the proportion of content in category <code>i</code>.</li>
            <li><code>1 - \text{NMI}(i,j)</code> penalizes the contribution of related categories.</li>
            <li><code>\log(n)</code> normalizes the score, ensuring comparability across channels with different numbers of categories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This metric would yield a higher diversity score for channels that cover unrelated categories across a broad spectrum, while channels with content that overlaps (related categories) would receive a lower diversity score.</p>
  
<h1>Testing the Metric: Validating the Concept</h1>

<p>To ensure the metric was working as expected, the researcher tested it on a set of example channels representing different types of content diversity:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Diverse-independent</strong>: Channels with a broad range of unrelated topics (e.g., "Science," "History," "Travel").</li>
    <li><strong>Diverse-related</strong>: Channels with multiple topics, but with some overlap (e.g., "Technology" and "Gaming").</li>
    <li><strong>Gaming-focused</strong>: Channels centered around a specific category like "Gaming," with minimal deviation.</li>
    <li><strong>Comedy-only</strong>: Channels focusing exclusively on one category, like "Comedy."</li>
</ul>

<p>The expected diversity scores were as follows:</p>

<div class="table-container">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Channel</th>
                <th>Diversity Score</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Diverse-independent</td>
                <td>2.775469</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Diverse-related</td>
                <td>1.633916</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gaming-focused</td>
                <td>0.589424</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Comedy-only</td>
                <td>0.000000</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<p><strong>The results seem to be coherent with our expectations. Nice!</strong></p>

<h1>Applying the Metric to Real-World Data</h1>

<img src="assets/img/Distribution_channel_density.png" alt="Distribution of Channel Density">

<p>The researcher now turned to real-world YouTube channels. After applying the metric to a large dataset, he observed a wide range of diversity scores. He suspected that these scores followed a Beta distribution, a common pattern for datasets where values tend to cluster at the extremes (low and high diversity).</p>

<p>The Beta distribution has the form:</p>

<p>
    <math display="block">
        f(x | α, β) = \frac{x^{α - 1}(1 - x)^{β - 1}}{B(α, β)}, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1
    </math>
</p>

<p>Where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are parameters that control the shape of the distribution. The researcher used Q-Q plots to compare the empirical data with theoretical distributions. Through these plots, he confirmed that the Beta distribution provided the best fit for the channel diversity scores.</p>

<p><strong>Insight:</strong> Most channels tend to focus on a narrow range of topics, leading to low diversity scores. Only a few channels adopt a truly diverse set of categories, explaining the long tail in the distribution.</p>

<h2>Exploring the Optimal Diversity Domain: Linking Diversity to Success</h2>

<p>Finally, the researcher turned his attention to the relationship between channel diversity and success. He hypothesized that there might be an optimal level of diversity for attracting a large subscriber base.</p>

<p>To investigate this, he divided the diversity scores into three categories: low, moderate, and high diversity. These categories were determined using quantiles derived from the Beta distribution, ensuring a balanced representation across channels.</p>

<p>Next, he analyzed whether different diversity levels correlated with higher subscriber counts. The analysis showed that moderate diversity channels consistently outperformed others in terms of subscribers. Channels that were neither too niche nor too broad in their content tended to attract the largest and most engaged audiences.</p>

<h3>Key Findings:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Low Diversity:</strong> Channels with a narrow focus often struggle to attract a wide audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Moderate Diversity:</strong> Channels that strike a balance between focus and variety attract the most subscribers.</li>
    <li><strong>High Diversity:</strong> Channels attempting to cover too many unrelated topics often fail to build a strong, engaged community.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through non-parametric statistical tests, the researcher confirmed that moderate diversity was statistically linked to greater success, particularly in terms of subscriber growth.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>The researcher sat back, deep in thought. His dream had led him to create a rigorous, quantitative metric for channel diversity, one that combined entropy and mutual information to reflect both the spread of content and the relatedness between categories. Through testing and analysis, he had demonstrated that a moderate level of content diversity was most effective for growing a channel’s audience.</p>

<p>Was this insight the result of his subconscious mind processing years of research? Or had the dream truly unlocked something more profound about the nature of content creation and its relationship to audience growth? As he continued his work, one thing was certain: the boundary between dreams and reality had never seemed so thin.</p>
