  <h1>Unveiling the Secrets Behind YouTube Categories</h1>
  <p>How does content diversity on YouTube influence audience engagement and channel growth?</p>
</section>

<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>With millions of videos and hundreds of thousands of channels, YouTube is a content universe. We explored whether channels benefit from focusing on a single category or covering many topics. Using the large-scale YouNiverse dataset, we reveal how content variety correlates with subscriber counts, engagement, and long-term growth.</p>
</section>

<section id="data-overview">
  <h2>The Data</h2>
  <p>The YouNiverse dataset contains over 136,000 English-language YouTube channels and more than 72 million videos. We focused on channels with more than 10k subscribers and at least 10 videos. This allowed us to capture established creators and avoid noise from very small channels.</p>

  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Do YouTube channels with diverse content attract larger audiences and higher growth rates than those focused on a single topic?</li>
    <li>How does content diversity affect viewer engagement and loyalty?</li>
    <li>Is there a tipping point in content variety where audience fragmentation outweighs engagement benefits?</li>
    <li>Are there any relationships between categories?</li>
    <li>Which combination of categories is most effective for audience growth?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to predict the categorical cluster of a channel giving timeseries data?</li>
  </ol>

<section id="global-analysis">
  <h2>I. Global Analysis of Categories</h2>
  <p>We began by examining the distribution of channel categories. Four categories—Music, Entertainment, Gaming, and People & Blogs—dominate both the number of channels and total subscribers.</p>

  <p>These dominant categories account for over 60% of channels and subscribers, shaping much of YouTube’s content landscape.</p>

  <h2>II. Content Ecosystems: Co-occurrence of Categories</h2>
  <p>Channels rarely produce content exclusively in one category. We mapped out category co-occurrences to uncover content 'ecosystems'.</p>

  <p>Entertainment and People & Blogs act as hubs, connecting various categories. A network of frequently co-occurring categories—Gaming, Music, Comedy, Film & Animation—emerges, suggesting these genres often blend together.</p>

  <h2>III. A Channel Diversity Metric</h2>
  <p>To quantify how varied a channel’s content is, we developed a metric that accounts for both the spread of categories and how related they are. Channels that cover many unrelated categories score higher on diversity than those focused on a single theme or closely related topics.</p>

  <p>We found that most channels lean towards lower diversity. A Beta distribution fits the diversity scores well, indicating that extreme variety is rare.</p>

<section id="optimal-diversity">
  <h2>IV. Finding the Optimal Diversity Range</h2>
  <p>Does more diversity always mean better performance? We split channels into low, moderate, and high diversity groups and examined their subscriber counts.</p>
  <img src="assets/images/subscriber_comparison.png" alt="Subscribers by Diversity Level" />
  <p>Surprisingly, channels in the moderate diversity range attracted more subscribers, suggesting a sweet spot where creators benefit from some variety without confusing their audience.</p>
</section>

<section id="time-series">
  <h2>V. Evolution of Channels Over Time</h2>
  <p>We compared how channels in entertainment-oriented categories (Gaming, Music, Film & Animation) differ from those in educational categories (Education, How-to, Science & Tech) over their first year.</p>
  <img src="assets/images/short_term_growth_views.png" alt="Short-term Views Growth Comparison" />
  <p>Entertainment channels experience sharp spikes in views tied to viral moments, followed by declines. Educational channels grow more steadily, showing the lasting value of evergreen content.</p>

  <img src="assets/images/short_term_growth_subscribers.png" alt="Short-term Subscriber Growth Comparison" />
  <p>Subscriber trends mirror views: Entertainment sees intense but short-lived surges, while educational channels accumulate subscribers gradually and more consistently over time.</p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This analysis highlights that while YouTube’s most popular categories dominate overall numbers, sustainable growth and engagement often come from balanced content strategies. Moderately diverse channels fare better in attracting loyal subscribers, and content with lasting relevance—like educational videos—builds stable growth patterns over time.</p>
  <p>These insights can guide creators in optimizing their content strategies: balancing variety with a recognizable identity may be the key to both attracting and retaining an engaged audience.</p>
